I am a translator, screenwriter, and software engineer. I have written dialogues for critically acclaimed Punjabi films Annhe Ghore Da Daan and Chauthi Koot. I curate Parchanve (https://parchanve.wordpress.com/
), a blog on translated Punjabi literature;  Says Hussain(https://sayshussain.wordpress.com/), a blog on poetry of Madho Lal Shah Hussain; and co-curate Kirrt (https://www.kirrt.org/), a visual archive of Punjabi labour.

I like creative nonfiction, miniature painting, documentary photography and slow cinema.
